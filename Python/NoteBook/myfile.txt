Why does anything cling to something?
Maybe they love wherever they're going so much that it's worth it.
Maybe they'll keep coming back, until there's only one star left.
Maybe that one star will make the trip forever, out of the hope that someday - if it keeps coming back often enough - another star will find it again.
